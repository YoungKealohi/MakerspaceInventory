Hey fun people! This is the stuff you gotta do to run the app on your device:
1. Install Node.js - download it here: https://nodejs.org/ and the install it. You want Node.js v18 or later.
2. Open the repo on your chosen code editor (mine is VS Code). Then, on cmd, cd into the MakerspaceInventory directory.
3. Run Node app.js
4. In a browser, go to http://localhost:3000
BTW I am on a PC. I'm not sure if this is different on a Mac

Optional:
6. Install MySQL Workbench to edit the db. I hosted it on AWS so that we are all working with the same db. The credentials are in the .env file.
